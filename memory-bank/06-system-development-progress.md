## 2026-03-05 — Files storage URL strategy alignment

- Unified files strategy for monolith backend:
  - `POST /api/v1/files/upload` returns **relative path** with `/files/` prefix.
  - Relative paths are normalized and persisted for user avatars/course covers.
  - API read models return **relative path** with `/files/` prefix (frontend composes full host URL).
- Implemented replacement lifecycle for avatars/covers:
  - old file is deleted on update when path changes;
  - file is deleted on entity removal (user/course deletion).
- Enabled direct static file serving from backend under `/files/**`:
  - added `StorageWebConfig` resource handler bound to `APP_STORAGE_ROOT_DIR`;
  - allowed unauthenticated read access to `/files/**` in security config.
- Runtime/env/docker alignment:
  - aligned to single storage config key `APP_STORAGE_ROOT_DIR` in compose/env examples.

## 2026-03-05 — Storage config simplification (single logic)

- Removed obsolete split storage settings:
  - dropped `app.storage.user-avatar-dir` and `app.storage.public-base-url` from `application.yml`;
  - dropped `APP_STORAGE_USER_AVATAR_DIR` and `APP_STORAGE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` from env/compose examples.
- Unified avatar upload path strategy with generic file upload strategy:
  - `UserService.updateUserAvatar(...)` now stores files via `fileStorageService.store(file, "uploads")`.
- Kept lifecycle behavior unchanged:
  - old avatar/cover files are deleted on replacement;
  - avatar/cover files are deleted on entity removal.
